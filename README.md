# DSA-in-Java

This repository contains implementations of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** in **Java**.  
It is meant for practice, interview preparation, and strengthening problem-solving skills.  

## Repository Structure

- **DSA-Array/** – Array-based problems (searching, sorting, rotated arrays).  
- **DSA02Strings/** – String manipulation and pattern problems.  
- **DSA03Recursion/** – Recursive algorithms and backtracking.  
- **Stacks/** – Stack-related problems and implementations.  
- **src/** – Additional problems (e.g., Sqrt(x)).  

## Future Scope
- Add problems on **Linked List, Trees, Graphs, and Dynamic Programming**.
